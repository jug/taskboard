# TODOs

# ---------- Bugs / Code-Improvements -----------------------------------------

* remove all CCPM-stuff, as that is no longer required

* bug: don't load taskboard twice on refresh
* bug: fix text-change "hours left" -> "hours", because the number represent now the 'hours spent' and not 'hours left'
* bug: replace <bug>-links & <jira>-links with general configurable markup for ticket-systems (more than one link)
* bug: delete-card doesn't delete taggings-assignment, card-hours(good)

* cleanup: check patches 'TODO: take it out of here!' in 'public/javascripts/lib/jquery.jeditable.js'

* cleanup(?): replace juggernaut with node.js approach !? ... because taskboard seem not to work any more with modern browsers

# ---------- Features ---------------------------------------------------------

* feature: search for cards -> taskboard

* feature: no backup if cards accidentally deleted -> history, db-backup, confirmation, more logging to restore !?

* feature: upgrade Taskboard to jQuery 1.4.3 (much faster), or even 1.5 (even more faster)

# ---------- Documentation ----------------------------------------------------

* doc: document all new features, add 'screenshots/'
